# Java_Projects_2

Project 1:
The program involves defining animal classes for simulation where critters infect others with DNA, transforming them into the infectorâ€™s species.

Project 2:
The program reads and prints out line from txt file and reverses the txt and prints again.

Project 3:
One program takes input word and computes canonical form. The other program takes input and prints out anagrams from dictionary text file.

Project 4:
The program creates recursive pattern of squares in a 3 by 3 grid.

Project 5:
The program compares data of students to allow sorting by grade.

Project 6:
The program reads data from and writes data to file. Program will process lines of a file and save the total dollar value of all the lines together and the average per line.

Project 7:
The Program takes infix notation, converts it to postfix expression, then evaluates it.

Project 8:
The program simulates a game of assassin and keeps track of the kill ring and graveyard.

Project 9:
The program is a converter that transforms numeric expression from infix notation into binary expression tree, then evaluates it.
